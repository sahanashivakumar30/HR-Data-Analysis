# HR Data Analytics Project: Attrition
## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing employee attrition in a company, using Excel as the tool for data exploration, visualization, and insight generation. The focus is on identifying patterns and correlations between attrition and variables such as demographics, job satisfaction, and job involvement, to help HR make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of employees, capturing a range of information relevant to attrition analysis. It includes demographic details such as age, gender, marital status, and education level. Job-related data covers the employee's department, job role, job level, and years spent at the company. To understand employee sentiment, the dataset also includes satisfaction metrics like job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance. In addition, it provides engagement indicators such as job involvement, performance rating, and whether the employee works overtime. The target variable, attrition, indicates whether an employee has left the company or not.

Specifically, 85 employees left from the 31–40 group (≈approximately 13.7%), and 84 employees left from the 21–30 group (≈approximately 23.5%), making it the highest proportion. Very young employees (under 21) also show a high attrition proportion, with 16 leaving and only 12 staying.
