# HR Data Analytics Project: Attrition
## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing employee attrition in a company, using Excel as the tool for data exploration, visualization, and insight generation. The focus is on identifying patterns and correlations between attrition and variables such as demographics, job satisfaction, and job involvement, to help HR make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle — https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itssuru/hr-employee-attrition

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 1,470 records of employees, capturing a range of information relevant to attrition analysis. It includes 35 variables- demographic details such as age, gender, marital status, and education level. Job-related data covers the employee's department, job role, job level, and years spent at the company. To understand employee sentiment, the dataset also includes satisfaction metrics like job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance. In addition, it provides engagement indicators such as job involvement, performance rating, and whether the employee works overtime. The target variable, attrition, indicates whether an employee has left the company or not.

## Key Insights
-	Overall Attrition Rate: Out of a total of 1,470 employees, 237 left the company, resulting in an attrition rate of approximately 16.1%.
-	Attrition by Age Range: The highest attrition is observed in the 31–40 and 21–30 age groups. Specifically, 85 employees left from the 31–40 group (≈approximately 13.7%), and 84 employees left from the 21–30 group (≈approximately 23.5%), making it the highest proportion. Very young employees (under 21) also show a high attrition proportion, with 16 leaving and only 12 staying.
-	Attrition by Department: The Sales department has the highest proportional attrition, with 92 out of 446 employees leaving (≈20.6%). In comparison, Research & Development saw 133 out of 961 employees leave (≈13.8%), and Human Resources had 12 out of 63 employees leave (≈19%).
-	Attrition vs. Overtime: Among employees who worked overtime, 127 out of 416 left the company, resulting in an attrition rate of approximately 30.5%. In contrast, among those who did not work overtime, only 110 out of 1,054 left (≈10.4%).
-	Attrition by Gender: Male employees have a higher attrition rate than female employees (10.2% vs. 5.92%). Despite representing a larger portion of the workforce (about 60%), males are leaving at a faster rate.
-	Attrition by Marital Status: Single employees are the most likely to leave, with an attrition rate of 25.5%. In contrast, divorced employees have the lowest attrition rate at 10.1%, while married employees fall in between at 12.5%.
-	Attrition by Department: Research & Development accounts for 56.3% of the workforce and 9.0% of total attrition, indicating that its higher attrition count is largely driven by its larger employee base rather than a disproportionately higher attrition rate.
-	Attrition by Shift: A Significant number of attrition can be noted among employees who work overtime in comparison to employees working regular shifts. 127 attrtion employees among 416 working overshift.
-	Attrition by Business Travel- Employees who travel frequently have an attrition rate of 25% compared to employees who rarely travel or do not have business travel as a job requirement.
-	Attrition by Job level: Attrition in different job can be seen to reduce as the job level increases from 1 to 5. Highest attrition 143 can be seen in job level 1 and reduces to 5 in job level 5.
-	Attrition based on monthly income, salary hike and stock option level: Lower the income higher the attrition rate. Similarly, lower the salary hike, higher the attrition rate and highest attrition among  employee with job roles that were not offered any company stock.
